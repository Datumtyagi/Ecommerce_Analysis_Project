# SQL Query Challenges
# Overview

This project focuses on extracting insights from a retail dataset using SQL queries. The queries are designed to address various aspects of data analysis, ranging from basic to advanced levels. The dataset includes information on customers, orders, products, sales, and payments. Below is a breakdown of the different types of queries used in this project.

# Query Breakdown

# Basic Queries

1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
   Retrieve a distinct list of cities from the customer database to understand the geographical 
   spread of the customer base.

2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
   Analyze the dataset to find the total number of orders placed in the year 2017.

3. Find the total sales per category.
   Aggregate sales data to calculate the total revenue generated by each product category.

4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
   Determine the proportion of orders where the payment method involved installments.

5. Count the number of customers from each state.
   Group the customers by their state of residence and count the number of customers per state.

# Intermediate Queries

1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
   Group and count the orders by month to observe the monthly order trends for the year 2018.

2. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
   Determine the average number of items purchased per order for each city, providing insights 
   into purchasing behaviors.

3. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
   Analyze the revenue contribution of each category as a percentage of the total revenue.

4. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been 
   purchased.
   Explore the relationship between the price of products and their purchase frequency.

5. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.
   Identify top-performing sellers by calculating and ranking their total revenue.

# Advanced Queries

1. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
   Compute a moving average to smooth out fluctuations in the order values over time for each 
   customer.

2. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
   Track the cumulative sales figures month by month, comparing the data year over year.

3. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
   Measure the growth in total sales by comparing year-over-year performance.

4. Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make 
   another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
   Assess customer loyalty by calculating how many customers return for a subsequent purchase 
   within a 6-month window.

6. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
   Rank customers based on their annual spending to identify the most valuable customers each 
   year.

# Conclusion
  This project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing retail data using SQL, covering a 
  range of queries from basic data retrieval to advanced analytics. By completing these 
  queries, valuable insights can be drawn, contributing to data-driven decision-making.
